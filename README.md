# 2DWorldGeneration

## Introduction
Hi! This project was created as a recruitment task to demonstrate my skills as a Unity Developer, focusing on procedural generation of 2D worlds. Using Perlin noise algorithms, the system generates tilemaps and populates them with environmental objects. 
Users can customize terrain types and objects using ScriptableObjects. A simple seed system allows for easy replication of generated worlds. The terrain type set, environment object set and preset settings included are just a simple example. 
I'm sure that in the hands of a more experienced designer the tool can be utilized even better.

## Features
- Procedural Generation: Create diverse 2D worlds using Perlin noise algorithms.
- Customization: Define terrain type and environment object sets with ScriptableObjects.
- Seed System: Easily replicate generated worlds with a simple seed system.
- Editor Integration: Generate worlds in the Unity editor or during runtime thanks to the custom editor scripts.
